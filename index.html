		Theres a lot of things to add here like me enjoying competitive gaming, streaming and that I am medically diagnosed with ASD which is Autism Spectrum Disorder but it isn't all that bad for I am on the high functioning side which means I am capable of livng on my own, having a job, but I still have the negatives that can still have an impact on my overall living situation but it's not all that bad. To add on to my about me is that in the begining I stated that I enjoy competitive gaming but that isn't the only thing I enjoy, I also tend to enjoy watching shows about firefighting and  documentaries which also goes for police related shows and real documentaries.
